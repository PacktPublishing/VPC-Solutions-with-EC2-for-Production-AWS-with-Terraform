## About the Video Course
Learn to implement production-ready infrastructures with AWS and Terraform today with an AWS Certified Solutions Architect!
You will learn not only how to implement Terraform code, but will also how to implement an AWS Well-Architected Framework-recommended deployment model that will be highly-available, scalable, fault-tolerant, and resilient!
In this course, we will start by exploring the tools we'll need throughout the course. You will need an IDE and an AWS account is also necessary. You will be shown how to get one if you do not already have one. We will set up our environment variables for Terraform deployments and also configure our IDE to use Terraform efficiently by installing a Terraform plugin. We will start off by implementing our remote state and obtaining a key pair, which we will use to connect to the instances we launch. Once we get these done, we will first create the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment. We'll also attach an Internet Gateway (IGW) to our VPC for use with public subnets, so their resources will be able to access and receive public internet traffic. We will proceed to implement our Launch Configurations for the public and private EC2 instances we will launch through Auto-Scaling Groups. We will use Target Tracking Scaling to help us use, scale, and manage our EC2 instances all by itself.
